# ðŸ“š Book Metadata Collector (Google Books API)

This repository contains a Python script used for academic research at **Utrecht University** as part of a Master's thesis. The goal is to enrich a dataset of ~200,000 book quotes (with title and author) by retrieving metadata such as:

- ðŸ“… `publishedDate`
- ðŸ“š `categories` (genres)
- ðŸ”¢ `industryIdentifiers` (ISBNs)

The metadata is retrieved via the **[Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books)** and stored locally in a CSV file.

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

- Input: A list of book titles and authors.
- The script sends a single API call per book using the Google Books API.
- The response is parsed and stored locally.
- The resulting data is **not shared or published**, and is only used for offline, non-commercial academic analysis.

## ðŸ§  Use Case
